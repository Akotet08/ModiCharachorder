# ModiCharachorder
The purpose of our project is to build a keymouse, which functions as a mouse and keyboard at the same time
we are going to make the object have an oval shape (printed using 3D printer)
we are using 
# Lots of buttons, that can be used as keys for our keyboard 
# Gyro : makes the mouse move to the desired direction
# Led : to make it have a colored light when we want to use the mouse

we hope that people would be able to write with a speed of light, by using our keymouse.
